Australian Fatal Road Accident Data Analysis- 1989-2021
###

Which types of road users are more likely to be involved in a fatal accident?

For my analysis in our Australian Fatal Road Accident Data Analysis- 1989-2021 Project, I plotted bar and pie charts to compare the types of road users involved in fatal accidents using Crash Data from 1989 to 2021.

From this data there I broke it down into a deeper look into the top two statistics, why this might be the case, with some possible causes and preventative ideas.

Using these plots, it is clear to see that the majority of road user type involved in fatal accidents is the motorcycle rider and in rare cases, a motorcycle passenger as well. This is an unsurprising conclusion that the risk of being killed or seriously injured is highest for motorcyclists due to the lower protection and extra vulnerability compared to a road user in a car.

In attempting to improve motorcycle safety in Australia a number of initiatives have been implemented, including:
•	Increased understanding about the use of appropriate protective clothing and gear 
•	Targeted safety campaigns and information sharing
•	Improved vehicle safety & technology such as anti-lock braking systems (ABS)
•	Additional motorcycle training and education, including a focus on defensive driving
Motorcycle riding is an increasingly popular form of transport in Australia for both commuting and recreational reasons. In 2017 a survey run by TAC, revealed in Victoria alone more than 420,000 Victorians held a motorcycle license or permit.

Our second largest road user fatality type is the pedestrian.

Almost everyone is a pedestrian at some point. People walk for leisure, to go to work, to school or the shops, and to access other modes of transport. 
Despite normally travelling the shortest distances compared to other road users, in the event of a crash involving a pedestrian, they have little to no protection compared to other road users so numbers are quite high.
Pedestrian fatalities on the road are also quite significant and can occur in many circumstances, such as:
•	Crossing the road and being struck on the near or far side
•	Lack of dedicated infrastructure eg. facilities for pedestrians such as footpaths, crossings and raised medians
•	Carelessness of surroundings either from the pedestrian, vehicle user or both parties
•	Playing, working in or otherwise occupying a traffic or emergency lane

A pedestrian can be defined as a person on foot, on or in a toy vehicle, pushing a pram (stroller) or wheelchair, in a pram, or in a motorised or non-motorised wheelchair which is not capable of travelling at a speed greater than 10km/h.
