We chose the "Australian Fatal Road Accident Data Set from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/deepcontractor/australian-fatal-car-accident-data-19892021)" for our group assignment.

The questions I did were:
1. Are Fatal Car Accidents decreasing over the years?
2. Fatal Accidents, which is the superior Gender?

1. Are Fatal Car Accidents decreasing over the years?
- Using Jupyter Notebook, I started by importing the matplot, pandas, numpy and scipy also bringing the Crash_Data.csv downloaded from Kaggle.
- I grouped the data by year and did a count against the the years to get my values.
- Then charted.

2. Fatal Accidents, which is the superior Gender?
- I grouped the data by year and did a count against the the years to get my values.
- Then charted.

At this moment after checking with my intructors that I realised my data set may not provide much value on it's own. So I did additional research to for reasons
why the decline could be occurring. I came up with a few possibilites below:
1. Technological Advances in Car safety features
2. Car regulations around safety standards
3. More road rules and also enforcement
4. Marketing and PR

After digging around on Google below website was perhaps the best around 
Car Safety Features/Standards - https://rac.com.au/car-motoring/info/future_history-of-car-safety
