//Car Crash data 1989-2021//

Data has been sourced from Kaggle. We have data related to fatal road accidents from 1989 to 2021.

1.First step was to clean the data.
2.Piechart to show the percentage.
3.Barchat to show to days of the week highest reported fatal road accident.


Q1: Pie Chart to find the percentage accident each state. Which shows Vic has highest reported fatal accident 19.40%. The high fatality count would be due to a number of factors, but perhaps most likely because of road conditions, serious accidents happen more often on regional roads than metropolitan ones. Plenty Road in Bundoora—not far from Melbourne’s CBD—is cited as Australia’s most dangerous road(reference-https://www.dinggo.com.au/blog/car-crash-statistics-australia)  However, it’s also worth remembering these states vary in size, population & geographic measure.

Q2: Used BarChart to find the Days of the week that highest accident reported. BarChart shows on a given week most road fatalities occur on Saturday. Common causes of accident are speeding, drink driving, fatigues driving and distracted driving
Saturday traffic is more social and higher risk for crash social driving more likely to involve alcohol.  According to the study, more people are consuming alcohol on the weekends, and more people are also feeling relaxed after the work week. This leads to more drunk driving crashes, as well as speeding and other forms of reckless driving.
